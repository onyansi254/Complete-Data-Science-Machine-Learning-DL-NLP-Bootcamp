    "\n",
    "This rule is used to find the probability of **either** of two events happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ **Mutually Exclusive Events:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Events that **cannot happen at the same time**.\n",
    "* Example: Tossing a coin ‚Äî getting heads **or** tails (you can't get both at once).\n",
    "* **Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\n",

    "#### ‚úÖ **Non-Mutually Exclusive Events:**\n",
