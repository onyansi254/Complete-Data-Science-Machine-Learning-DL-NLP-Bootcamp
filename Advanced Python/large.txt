## About Me - Richard Otwoma

### Chapter 1: A Curious Mind from East Africa  
I’m Richard Otwoma, a data scientist and aspiring environmental technologist from Kenya. Growing up surrounded by the natural beauty of East Africa sparked my early fascination with nature and technology. This curiosity grew into a deep desire to understand the world through data and to use that understanding to create meaningful change—especially in areas that impact communities and the environment.

### Chapter 2: Learning Through Data  
My educational path has been shaped by a drive to explore how data can be used for problem-solving. Through the KCB Foundation, I earned a certification in Data Science, equipping me with practical skills in Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK. I’ve complemented this with intermediate SQL training as part of a data engineering program, allowing me to manage and analyze datasets with confidence.

### Chapter 3: Data-Driven Projects for Real-World Impact  
My portfolio is built on applying data science to solve relevant challenges. Notable projects include:
- **Student Exam Performance Prediction**
- **Stock Sentiment Prediction System**
- **Medicine Recommendation System**
- **Wildfire Prediction Challenge** ([GitHub](https://github.com/onyansi254/WildfirePredictionChallenge))

In these projects, I used machine learning and analytics to uncover patterns and support decision-making. The wildfire project especially inspired me to explore the intersection of environmental science and data.

### Chapter 4: From Code to Conservation  
In 2024, I contributed to a data challenge with FreeBorn Inc. to identify the most suitable African city for a new headquarters. I analyzed air quality, sustainability, and cost-of-living data from Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Burundi. This involved data cleaning, spatial analysis, and visual storytelling using tools like Google Sheets and Google Slides.

This project reinforced how data can guide policy, highlight environmental inequities, and support sustainable urban development—values closely aligned with the goals of the National Geographic + Nature Conservancy Externship.

### Chapter 5: Skills That Serve the Planet  
Beyond data science, I have experience in:
- **Front-end and Back-end Development** – creating web apps with HTML/CSS, Node.js, and MySQL
- **Mapping and Geolocation Projects** – building a Django app that collects IP-based location data
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – integrating LLMs and web scraping to retrieve contextual information

These skills are not only technical—they’re tools I hope to apply in conservation, environmental mapping, and community-focused projects.

Chapter 6: Values and Vision  
I believe that technology should be a force for good. Whether it’s visualizing deforestation patterns or mapping underserved regions, I’m committed to using data to uplift both people and the planet. I’ve applied to initiatives like:
- DLT Talents Program – to understand decentralized tech for transparency in climate action
- Circular Economy Journey Nairobi – to address waste through innovation

These experiences reflect my growing commitment to sustainability, impact-driven design, and ethical tech.

Chapter 7: Looking Ahead  
My goals include:
- Becoming a leader in environmental data visualization and mapping
- Using AI to monitor biodiversity, pollution, and urban sustainability
- Collaborating with global teams on projects that merge conservation and technology

I see the National Geographic + Nature Conservancy Externship as a stepping stone to contribute meaningfully, learn from experienced mentors, and grow as a conservation technologist.
