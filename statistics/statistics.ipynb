    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Why Do We Divide by $n - 1$ Instead of $n$ in Sample Variance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is due to **Bessel’s Correction**. It corrects the bias in the estimation of the population variance from a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In sample variance, we use the **sample mean ($\\bar{x}$)** instead of the **true population mean ($\\mu$)**.\n",
    "* The sample mean itself is calculated from the same data, which tends to **underestimate** the population variance.\n",
    "* Dividing by $n - 1$ instead of $n$ compensates for this bias, giving a more accurate estimate of the population variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $n - 1$ adjusts for the fact that we've already \"used up\" one degree of freedom by calculating the sample mean.\n",
    "* This ensures that the variance isn’t underestimated.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Possible Interview Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why do we use $n - 1$ instead of $n$ in the sample variance formula?**\n",
    "   *Expected Answer:*\n",
    "   To correct for bias caused by using the sample mean instead of the population mean, ensuring an unbiased estimate of the population variance (Bessel’s Correction).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explain the difference between population variance and sample variance.**\n",
    "   *Expected Answer:*\n",
    "   Population variance uses the actual population mean and divides by $N$, while sample variance uses the sample mean and divides by $n - 1$ to adjust for bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is meant by \"degrees of freedom\" in statistics?**\n",
    "   *Expected Answer:*\n",
    "   Degrees of freedom refer to the number of independent values that can vary in an analysis. In sample variance, we subtract 1 because one value (the mean) is already fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **When would you use sample variance instead of population variance?**\n",
    "   *Expected Answer:*\n",
    "   When you're working with a sample and trying to estimate the variance of the larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What happens if you mistakenly divide by $n$ instead of $n - 1$ for sample variance?**\n",
    "   *Expected Answer:*\n",
    "   You’d underestimate the true population variance because you wouldn’t account for the bias introduced by estimating the mean from the sample itself.\n",
